# Welcome to my GitHub Profile 👋

Hello, I'm Mohammed (@Demahom1412). I'm currently a first-year Master's student in computer science, passionate about development and all things tech. My main goal on GitHub is to learn, collaborate with fellow programming enthusiasts, and share my projects.

## About Me

- 👨‍🎓 Currently in my first year of a Master's program in computer science.
- 👨‍💻 Enthusiastic about software development, nothing in particular as long as I'm working on fun things.
- 🌱 Continuously evolving, learning, and growing as a developer.

## My Projects

I'm currently engaged in a diverse range of projects that align with my skills, interests, and aspirations. While I'm not pushing updates at the moment, I plan to do so once I complete my ongoing class project.

Currently, my primary focus is on the following two projects:

 - ****Twitter Sentiment Analysis (Python, Vue)****: I'm actively working on a project that involves sentiment analysis on Twitter data. This project leverages Python for data analysis and Vue for the frontend to provide insightful sentiment trends.

- ****Country Learning Android App (Jetpack Compose)****: In addition, I'm developing an Android application centered around learning about countries. This app utilizes Jetpack Compose to create a modern and interactive user experience for exploring and understanding different countries.
